# Colocalisation diagnostics (auto-generated)

This file is populated by `assemble_features` when building the full feature set.
It summarises the coverage of colocalisation data across loci and reports the
counts for each mutually exclusive status flag:

- `coloc_status_no_pairs`
- `coloc_status_pairs_no_mapped_gene`
- `coloc_status_mapped_gene_no_nearest`
- `coloc_status_nearest_match`

The report also includes aggregate counts of loci with any colocalisation pairs,
mapped QTL genes, and loci where the nearest gene appears among mapped colocalis
ation pairs.
